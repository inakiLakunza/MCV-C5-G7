# MCV-C5-G7
This repository contains Group 7's project materials. The group is formed by Marco Cordón, Cristian Gutiérrez, Merlés Subirá and Iñaki Lacunza, students of the Master in Computer Vision, in the Autonomous Univeristy of Barcelona.

## Week 1: PyTorch vs PyTorch Lightning
We had to compare our original implementation using PyTorch and this week's new version implemented using PyTorch Lightning.

## Week 2: Object Detection, Recognition and Segmentation
We had to implement the Detectron2 pipeline to use Masked R-CNN and Faster R-CNN, for detection, recognition and segmentation (just Masked R-CNN) tasks.
