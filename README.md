# MCV-C5-G7
This repository contains Group 7's project materials. The group is formed by Marco Cordón, Cristian Gutiérrez, Merlés Subirá and Iñaki Lacunza, students of the Master in Computer Vision, in the Autonomous Univeristy of Barcelona.

## Week 1: PyTorch vs PyTorch Lightning
We had to compare our original implementation using PyTorch and this week's new version implemented using PyTorch Lightning.

## Week 2: Object Detection, Recognition and Segmentation
We had to implement the Detectron2 pipeline to use Masked R-CNN and Faster R-CNN, for detection, recognition and segmentation (just Masked R-CNN) tasks.

## Week 3: Image retrieval
We had to trained a series of models with Contrastive Learning,  building first the embeddings and then performing image retrieval onto those.

## Week 4: Cross-Modal Retrieval
We have used triplet networks in order to relationate image embeddings with caption embeddings from different modalities.

## Week 5: Diffusion models
We have understand and used different diffusion models for data augmenting the previous week's database and improving the obtained results.

## Week 6: Multimodal human analysis
We have used a combination of a image model, a audio model and a text model in order to create a multimodal model, and used it to classify input data (img, audio and text) in age categories.
